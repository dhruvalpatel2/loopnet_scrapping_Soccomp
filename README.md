Social Impact On US Businesses 
Contributors - Dhruval Patel, Manan Patel 


Why this App  - Initially started building this app to have business listings along with the impact on businesses in those areas so we came up with the idea of creating this app using R-shiny which allowed us to create multiple visualizations, and interactive maps with the data we screaped. 


The Data - there are four tables we are using,

Shiny_app_data.csv - This file contains all the listings of businesses for sale in the US from LoopNet and it includes information on the businesses such as price, location, geocoordinates, square feet, and building type. 
Source - https://www.loopnet.com/ 


Us_states_data.csv - This file contains all the social demographics of states such as the ruling governor party, income tax rate, property tax, median household income, crime rate per 100k, and population.

NJ_Income - This file contains income distribution data for each New Jersey county. 

NJ_sex_data - this contains age, sex, and ethnicity data for all the counties in new jersey. 


Data Cleaning - we cleaned the data using regular expressions as well as well as manually adding and removing of the columns, and used googleâ€™s api key to get geocoordinates of the listings which helped us visualize the data. 

Mapping/Plotting  - we mainly used ggplot in R to plot bar plots, then geom map and leaflet libraries to correctly show elements on the USA map. 

UI - the app contains 4 pages/panels 

1st page - US Listings Map which has an interactive map of the US with all the business listings with information. 

2nd page - US map with Social demographics such as the ruling governor party, income tax rate, property tax, median household income, crime rate per 100k, and population, then a table that allows filtration of data (top 5 states with lowest crime rate, highest median household income), additional data analysis of states. 

3rd page - Barplot visual of household income by counties in New Jersey. 

4th page - Barplot and pie chart visual of Age, sex, and ethnicity data of New Jersey counties.
